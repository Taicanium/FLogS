# Known Issues
- Ads are read correctly as they are in later versions, but much older clients didn't record ads as uniquely ID'd messages - they appear to have just been plaintext, with no delimiter. Reading them causes patches of garbage.

# Todo
- Preliminary scan of selected destination files, if they exist. If they appear at a glance to be un-translated user logs, refuse to overwrite them. (i.e. if it appears the user accidentally used a source log as the destination)
- Android version for mobile users of F-Chat.
