# Known Issues
- Ads are read correctly as they are in later versions, but much older clients didn't record ads as uniquely ID'd messages - they appear to have just been plaintext, with no delimiter. Reading them causes patches of garbage.
- The scrollbar on the log window cannot be enabled under any circumstances, as in I have memory-manipulated it to be active and it still doesn't work. This presents a problem with viewing error messages when they appear.

# Todo
- Android version for mobile users of F-Chat.
