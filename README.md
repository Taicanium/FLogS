# FLogS

An experimental WPF application intended to salvage data from heavily corrupted F-Chat log files.

Got a log that the native F-Chat 3.0 client can't read anymore? This app might just be your saving grace! It cannot repair log corruption, but it is capable of pulling out any and all messages in a bad file that might have survived. It converts those messages to plaintext Ã  la the ADL record bot, and saves them to a location of your choosing.

Further instructions and information are available in the app's Help screen.
