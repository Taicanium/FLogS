# FLogS
 Experimental WPF application that accepts corrupted F-Chat log files as input and extracts any messages which are still intact.

 This application does not manipulate or alter log files, nor can it be used for that purpose. Its output is plaintext, and cannot be accepted by F-Chat staff during a dispute.
