# FLogS

An experimental WPF application intended to salvage data from heavily corrupted F-Chat log files.

This application does not alter or modify a user's log files in any fashion. Its output cannot be accepted by F-List staff in case of a dispute.

This application is not affiliated with F-List, F-Chat, or Bad Dragon Enterprises.
